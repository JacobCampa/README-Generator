# README.md Generator

## Description
This generator is a Command Line Application to creating a professional README file to use for all your projects. The puropse of creating this application is to try to make the process easier by being prompted with all the information needed to get the basic skeleton created and formatted. You will be able to get a lot of your information created with the application but for smaller more intricate details you will need to go into the file once created and implimant the changes there.

## Installation
You will need <mark>Nodejs</mark>

> https://github.com/JacobCampa/README-Generator

When the code is accessed, make sure the node modules are up to date by imputting the following command:

once you have made sure everything is up to date, you may run the application using the command:

> `node index.js`

You should then be greeted with a series of prompts related to the creation of your README file. Below is a screenshot of the questions you will be prompted with. If you choose to not want to add any input to a certain area the file will output a "Not Available" inside the given area. You may also do this if you wish to add more later, but this will help give you a good stucture to start eith if you feel that you don't know where to start.

The last 2 prompts will be to input your GitHub Username and email for contacting you. They will already be formatted into a sentence with a url so you will only need the actual username and not the entire GitHub url. It will look like tthe following image once created:

Once all prompts have been answered and the terminal shows a successful creation you have your new README file the is titled: "newREADME.md"

You will be able to go into the file and make any changes you need or delete sections you don't want. Hopefully this application will help you build better README files for your projects and help improve the overall quality.
